# Entra Local

**A local emulator for Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), built for application developers.**

Entra Local exposes the same OpenID Connect / OAuth 2.0 endpoints that **MSAL** talks to —
plus a minimal Microsoft Graph surface and a web portal to register users and applications.
Point your app's `authority` at the emulator and develop sign-in, token acquisition, and
protected-API calls **offline, with no cloud tenant, and no shared-tenant clutter**.

> ⚠️ **Development tool only.** Entra Local is intentionally insecure for the sake of
> developer ergonomics (open admin portal, self-signed certs, seeded secrets). Never use it
> in production or expose it to untrusted networks.

---

## Why?

Testing against a real Entra ID tenant is slow and heavyweight: it needs cloud access and
admin consent, clutters shared tenants with throwaway app registrations, and can't run
offline or deterministically in CI. Entra Local is a drop-in identity provider that speaks
the same protocols, so your MSAL-based app works against it with only configuration changes.

## Features (MVP)

- 🔐 **MSAL-compatible OIDC/OAuth2 endpoints** — discovery, JWKS, authorize, token,
  device code, logout, userinfo.
- 🎫 **Supported flows** — Authorization Code + PKCE, Client Credentials, Refresh Token,
  Device Code.
- 🪪 **Real RS256-signed JWTs** — ID and access tokens validatable against a working JWKS
  endpoint.
- 👥 **Minimal Microsoft Graph** — read `/me`, `/users`, `/groups`.
- 🖥️ **Web portal** — register users, groups, and app registrations; copy ready-to-paste
  MSAL config snippets.
- 💾 **SQLite persistence** — state survives restarts; deterministic seed data for CI.
- 🔒 **HTTPS by default** — auto-generated, persisted self-signed certificate.
- 📦 **Run anywhere** — `npm start`, a single executable, or a Docker container.

> Out of scope for the MVP: multi-tenant directories, Implicit flow, ROPC, OBO, SAML /
> WS-Federation, MFA, Conditional Access, and full Graph parity. See the
> [roadmap](specs/roadmap.md).

```

## Quick start

> Status: **specification phase.** The implementation is being built against
> [`specs/global-spec.md`](specs/global-spec.md). The commands below are the intended
> developer experience.

```bash
# From source
npm install
npm start
# Portal:    https://localhost:8443/admin
# Discovery: https://localhost:8443/{tenantId}/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration
```

```bash
# Docker (intended)
docker run -p 8443:8443 -v entra-local-data:/data entra-local
```

### Point MSAL at the emulator

```jsonc
// Example (@azure/msal-browser) — generated per app in the portal
{
  "auth": {
    "clientId": "<appId from the portal>",
    "authority": "https://localhost:8443/11111111-1111-1111-1111-111111111111",
    "knownAuthorities": ["localhost:8443"],
    "redirectUri": "https://localhost:3000"
  }
}
```

Trust the emulator's self-signed certificate (or relax cert validation in dev) so MSAL can
fetch the discovery document and JWKS over HTTPS.

## Development

The toolchain and project layout are established by roadmap feature #1
([spec](specs/2026-06-22_01-server-config-tls-foundation.md)). Node **22.5+** is required
(the persistence layer uses the built-in `node:sqlite`).

```bash
npm install        # install dependencies
npm run dev        # run the server with reload (tsx watch)
npm run build      # type-check + emit server to dist/ (+ portal placeholder)
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit across server + tests
npm run lint       # eslint + prettier --check
npm test           # unit + integration tests (vitest, in-process, deterministic)
npm run test:e2e   # real-MSAL end-to-end suite (starts a real HTTPS server)
npm start          # run the built server (node dist/index.js)
```

Configuration is loaded from environment variables → `entra-local.config.json` → built-in
defaults (highest precedence first) and validated on startup; see
[`.env.example`](.env.example) and
[`entra-local.config.example.json`](entra-local.config.example.json) for the full reference.
Invalid config aborts startup with a non-zero exit naming the offending key.

Source layout: `src/` (server) with `config/` (zod validation), `tls/` (cert generation),
`http/` (routing, path map, error handling); `test/` (`unit/`, `integration/`, `e2e/`,
`helpers/`); `portal/` (admin portal, built in #12). Runtime state (SQLite DB + the persisted
self-signed cert) lives under `data/` (gitignored).

> **Browser e2e (`@azure/msal-browser` via Playwright)** is wired in the harness but gated
> behind `E2E_BROWSER=1` until the interactive sign-in flow lands (#6), so `npm run test:e2e`
> is green without a browser download.

## Project status & roadmap

Entra Local is in early design. The current focus is **Iteration 1 (MVP)** in the
[roadmap](specs/roadmap.md): the core Authorization Code + PKCE sign-in loop (plus Refresh
Token and Client Credentials), UserInfo/Logout, minimal Graph, the admin portal, and
`npm start` + Docker. Iteration 2 adds Device Code, optional password login, and
single-executable packaging. Multi-tenant, OBO, broader Graph, and cert-based client auth
are deferred.
